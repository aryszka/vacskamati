# vacskamati

A truly TRASH style distributed note taking tool.


### Dev Notes

- the template processor a dangerously simplistic solution. It works, but one important restriction is that only
  one include is allowed per line.
- currently only make debug is working, because uglifyjs doesn't uglify es6, and test-interop.js is in es6,
  which is a temp file.
 

### Dev Next Steps:

- testing
- find an editor
- integrate service workers with elm
